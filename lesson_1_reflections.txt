First time using fc was a success! :) 6/14/15

I was able to see what lines had been changed and was able to
notice the spelling error myself.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to
create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically
saved, like Google docs does?
-Less wasted commits, less useless history, more practical commits.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving
multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat
each file separately?
-Git is made for code and programs that use multiple files cohesively 
so it is good to store changes that affect the program as a whole, 
while Google Docs is mainly used for single file use that is updated by 
itself.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history 
of files?
-you can get the log of all the commits made to the files and then view 
the diffs by comparing the diff id's.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes 
that could break something?
-Now you can make changes and always revert back to a state that was 
working, assuming that it was working before you commit new changes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using 
Git for?
-Having confidence to take chances and make changes that I normally 
wouldn't feel comfortable making.  Being able to share and control 
versions is important for working on bugs while a working version is 
made public.
