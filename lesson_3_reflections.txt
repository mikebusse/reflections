When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-When you want to work on different computers, or share a file with people, or to have an offsite backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-Someone else might be working on a file that you don't want to update until you have checked out their version compared to the version you have.
