1. When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-When you want to work on different computers, or share a file with people, or to have an offsite backup.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-Someone else might be working on a file that you don't want to update until you have checked out their version compared to the version you have.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
-Forks are when you want to create your own version of somebody elses work on GitHub. Branches are made either 
locally or on GitHub and are parellel to the original/Master file, they are able to rejoin the master if desired.
 Clones are the same as forks on local machines.

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
-To compare changes that might have been uploaded to GitHub by another person.

5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
-I would have to manually keep track of all the changes and versions that were in use, as well as logs 
that keep track of all the information that has been changed. I think it would be a lot harder to collaborate
without Git or GitHub. The system keeps it so nice and organized to make changes, and has a solution for just 
about ever circumstance imaginable.
